# NLP-Interview-Task, December 2022
NLP Interview Task - University of Birmingham Medical School

## 1. Overview

For the research position interview we are asking that candidates prepare two items:
1. Two slides introducing themselves, their research history, and interests.
2. Two slides describing their approach and findings for a small NLP task (described in this document).

## 2. NLP Task
### 2.1 Dataset
Download the following datasets:
1. https://raw.githubusercontent.com/reality/intask/main/pt_notes.csv
2. https://raw.githubusercontent.com/reality/intask/main/patients.csv

They describe a set of textual clinical notes describing patient admissions in a critical care setting.

### 2.2 Task
Perform an exploratory stratification of biomedical entities based on the text, such as admissions, diseases,
or phenotypes, with a focus on exploring hypothetical relationships that can be discovered from the text.
The presentation should focus on methodology, findings, and next steps.

### 2.3 Conditions
1. Please do not spend more than 2 hours on the task, and do not provide more than 2 slides describing
your approach and results. The task is intended as a jumping-off point for discussion during the
interview, and as such more time spent on the problem will not confer a greater advantage.
2. Any software environment or toolset you want to use is okay.
